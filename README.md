# Machine Learning Lab

MachineLearningLab is a C# project developed as part of a Machine Learning Concepts course. It provides implementations of several fundamental machine learning algorithms, offering both a practical exploration into machine learning techniques and a platform for further development and experimentation.

## Overview

The project demonstrates the following algorithms implemented from scratch in C#:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies data points based on the proximity of neighboring points.
- **Decision Tree:** Uses a tree-like model to make decisions based on feature attributes.
- **Logistic Regression:** Performs binary classification by predicting the probability of an outcome.
- **Linear Regression:** Estimates continuous values based on input features.
- **C-Means (K-Means):** Partitions data into clusters based on feature similarity.
- **Fuzzy C-Means:** An enhanced clustering algorithm that allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership.

## Key Achievements

- **Algorithm Accuracy:** Each algorithm has been rigorously tested and optimized, ensuring high accuracy in both classification and regression tasks.
- **Scalability:** The implementations are designed to efficiently process large datasets.
